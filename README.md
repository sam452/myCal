My Calendar project
===============

Goal
---------------------
myCal is a Ruby implementation of the UNIX cal command. Ultimately it will handle up to a year
but it presently only handles a month.

Features
---------------------
From a month and year given to it as parameters, it returns to the STDOUT a pretty output of that month in a calendar format.

###Limitations
---------------------
myCal is able to handle months from 1800 to the year 3000. 

###How to use it
Clone the code to your computer and using the Terminal application navigate to the directory you saved it and type:
> cal.rb 02 2002

###Dependencies
myCal was tested against Ruby 1.9.3 and uses the standard libraries.
